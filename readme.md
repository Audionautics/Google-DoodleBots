My lunch break pass-time during the olympics: beating the Google Doodles. 

Note that the only one that does anything actually interesting is the soccer one. The other two basically spam key presses. But, eh, for sake of completeness. Here they are. 

There are also a couple of "magic numbers" in the code. These are unique to my setup at my resolution. You'll have to 
swap my coordinates out for those relevant to your machine. 

Modules Needed:
